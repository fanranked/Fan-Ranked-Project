# Fan-Ranked-Project
This is the Fan Ranked Project, crowdsourced fantasy baseball rankings.

The framework for the website is as follows

Users will be shown two random MLB or MILB players side by side as they enter the website. The user will vote for which player they would prefer to own this season (dynasty FB rankings are the goal, but may be more cyumbersome at first)

Players wil be ranked by how many times they were voted for and against, and the quality of the players they have been voted against. 

The minimum for this will be a database of all players that will want to be ranked, and a way to rank them against each other.
